  title: Common Hosted Form Service (CHEFS)
  description: >-
    The API for an application for teams to create, manage and publish web
    forms. These back-end operations can work for different form builder tools
    that define the form as a json schema. Form management features include
    role-based access for administrators, form versioning, submission review and
    export, as well as notifications, document generation and reporting.

  - name: Form
    description: >-
      The API paths in this section are used to read and write data that make up
      a web form, for example, the form schema object, metadata, and related
      settings
  - name: Form API
    description: >-
      This section supports the creation, management and removal of form scoped
      API Key secrets. CHEFS endpoints which permit Basic Authentication use the
      Form ID as username and the API Key as the password.
  - name: Version
    description: >-
      The API supports versioning of forms. This allows a user to manage
      multiple versions of a form design and, for example, publish a specific
      version of a form.
  - name: Draft
    description: >-
      This section of the API includes endpoints used to perform various
      operations related to form drafts, for example create or publish a draft
      from a specific version of a form.
  - name: Document Templates
    description: >
      Documents can be generated using the Common Document Generation Service
      ([CDOGS](https://bcgov.github.io/common-service-showcase/services/cdogs.html)).
      Form submission data is merged into a user-defined _document template_ to
      create the document.

      > This is an experimental API that is currently only MVP, and it will
      change rapidly. It is best to avoid using these endpoints (outside of the
      CHEFS app itself) until they stabilize.


      Currently only a single document template per form is supported by the
      CHEFS application:
        1. The `POST /forms/{formId}/documentTemplates` route is used to create
           a document template for a form.
        2. Subsequent calls to the `POST` route should be paired with calls to
           the `DELETE` route to delete the previously active template.
        
      Submission metadata is available for use in the document templates:
        - `{d.chefs.submissionId}`: the unique identifier for the submission,
          such as `3cb9acc7-cfd8-4491-b091-1277bc0ec303` 
        - `{d.chefs.confirmationId}`: The uppercased first eight characters of
          the `submissionId`, such as `3CB9ACC7`
        - `{d.chefs.formVersion}`: The numeric version of the form that was used
          to create the submission, such as `1`
  - name: Submission
    description: >-
      These API endpoints handle the input data provided by a user that
      completes the form, for example, writing the form data to the database, or
      exporting form submissions created during a defined time period.
  - name: Status
    description: >-
      These API endpoints handle operations to update and retrieve statuses and
      notes on a submission, and status code management for a Form.
  - name: Email Recipients
    description: >-
      These API endpoints handle operations to update and retrieve email
      recipients for a form when the status is set to REVISING or COMPLETED.
  - name: Files
    description: API endpoints to upload and retrieve files stored in CHEFS.
  - name: User
    description: >-
      The section includes API endpoints for carrying out operations with data
      related to users of the application.
  - name: Role
    description: >-
      The API includes endpoints for managing roles assigned to users. A role,
      for example, 'Form Designer' or 'Submission Reviewer' will often
      correspond to the business functions of a user's job. Roles have a group
      of related permissions that are used to control access to a defined set of
      features of and application.
  - name: Permission
    description: >-
      The API uses Permissions to control access to a defined set of features of
      and application, for example, reading form submissions or updating the
      design of a form. Permissions are assigned to roles.
  - name: RBAC
    description: >-
      This section of the API documents the API endpoints related to Role-based
      Access Control (RBAC). RBAC is a method of restricting access based on
      roles. These endpoints handle a combination of user, role and permission
      data as well as the access settings for a published form.
  - name: Admin
    description: >-
      These API endpoints are used for elevated permission administrative calls.
      All calls are secured by a role that operational team members will be
      granted and allow fetching some details about forms without needing a
      user->form permission.

        #### Common Document Generation Service (CDOGS)

        This endpoint is a passthrough to CDOGS. Instead of using *BasicAuth* to
        call this endpoint, it is highly recommended that you [directly call
        CDOGS](https://bcgov.github.io/common-service-showcase/services/cdogs.html).
        Benefits of calling CDOGS directly from your application:
          - avoid CHEFS API rate limiting restrictions
          - avoid CHEFS API timeout restrictions (for large documents)
          - better performance (direct call instead of passthrough)
          - ability to use the CDOGS template cache
          - direct support from the CDOGS team for your specific Client ID
