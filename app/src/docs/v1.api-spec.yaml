  - name: Form
    description: >-
      The API paths in this section are used to read and write data that make up
      a web form, for example, the form schema object, metadata, and related
      settings
  - name: Form API
    description: >-
      This section supports the creation, management and removal of form scoped
      API Key secrets. CHEFS endpoints which permit Basic Authentication use the
      Form ID as username and the API Key as the password.
  - name: Version
    description: >-
      The API supports versioning of forms. This allows a user to manage
      multiple versions of a form design and, for example, publish a specific
      version of a form.
  - name: Draft
    description: >-
      This section of the API includes endpoints used to perform various
      operations related to form drafts, for example create or publish a draft
      from a specific version of a form.
  - name: Submission
    description: >-
      These API endpoints handle the input data provided by a user that
      completes the form, for example, writing the form data to the database, or
      exporting form submissions created during a defined time period.
  - name: Status
    description: >-
      These API endpoints handle operations to update and retrieve statuses and
      notes on a submission, and status code management for a Form.
  - name: Files
    description: API endpoints to upload and retrieve files stored in CHEFS.
  - name: User
    description: >-
      The section includes API endpoints for carrying out operations with data
      related to users of the application.
  - name: Role
    description: >-
      The API includes endpoints for managing roles assigned to users. A role,
      for example, 'Form Designer' or 'Submission Reviewer' will often
      correspond to the business functions of a user's job. Roles have a group
      of related permissions that are used to control access to a defined set of
      features of and application.
  - name: Permission
    description: >-
      The API uses Permissions to control access to a defined set of features of
      and application, for example, reading form submissions or updating the
      design of a form. Permissions are assigned to roles.
  - name: RBAC
    description: >-
      This section of the API documents the API endpoints related to Role-based
      Access Control (RBAC). RBAC is a method of restricting access based on
      roles. These endpoints handle a combination of user, role and permission
      data as well as the access settings for a published form.
  - name: Admin
    description: >-
      These API endpoints are used for elevated permission administrative calls.
      All calls are secured by a role that operational team members will be
      granted and allow fetching some details about forms without needing a
      user->form permission.
