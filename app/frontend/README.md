# CHEFS Frontend

This is the CHEFS frontend. It implements a Vue frontend with Keycloak authentication support.

## Configuration

The CHEFS frontend will require some configuration. The API it invokes will be locked down and require a valid JWT Token to access. We will need to configure the application to authenticate using the same Keycloak realm as the [app](../). Note that the Vue Skeleton frontend is currently designed to expect all associated resources to be relative to the original access path.

## Super Quickstart
